# PrinterBot

PrinterBot is a discord bot that takes print queries from users and prints them
using a receipt printer.

## Ok Cool, but Why?

I thought it would be funny, and it also seems like a fun project.

## Features

Here's a few things the bot can do

-   Print messages or text files uploaded by users, with proper formatting
    -   MarkDown files and code blocks will be printed with proper headings,
        formatting, etc.
-   Whitelist certain users for printing, or allow everyone to print
-   Print ESC/POS command text files sent to the bot outside of discord,
    allowing easy integration of other print tasks
