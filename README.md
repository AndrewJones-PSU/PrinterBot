# PrinterBot

PrinterBot is an application that takes print queries from users and prints them
using a receipt printer. The application is primarily designed to interface
through a discord bot, but it can be configured to accept files from other
sources as well.

## Ok Cool, but Why?

I thought it would be funny, and it also seems like a fun project.

## Features

Here's a few things the application can do

-   Print messages or text files uploaded by discord users, with proper
    formatting
    -   MarkDown files and code blocks will be printed with proper headings,
        formatting, etc.
    -   Certain users can be whitelisted for printing, or everyone can be
        allowed to print
-   Print files sent to the bot outside of discord, allowing easy integration of
    other print tasks
